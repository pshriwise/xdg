XDG Design Philosophy
=====================

A UML diagram of the current XDG class hierarchy is shown below:

The primary design goals of XDG are centered on the following:

- **Mesh Library Abstraction**: all mesh-based operations in XDG are
  abstracted through a common interface, the ``MeshManagerInterface``. This
  allows for the use of multiple mesh libraries without changing the core
  XDG codebase. A minimal implementation of the interface can be found in
  the ``mesh_mock.h`` file in the test suite and is only ~100 lines long.

- **Separation of Mesh and RayTracing Implementations**: XDG is designed to
  separate the concerns of mesh interfaces and ray tracing. Mesh libraries
  often implement their own acceleration data structures and ray tracing
  algorithms. XDG is designed to build on top of these libraries and provide
  a common interface for ray tracing operations that works for all of the
  supported mesh libraries (see :ref:`xdg_intro`). This makes the library
  agile and able to leverage the strengths of multiple mesh libraries along
  with modern ray tracing algorithms.

- **Ray Tracing Interface Abstraction**: all ray tracing operations in XDG are
  abstracted through a common interface, the ``RayTracingInterface``. This
  allows for the use of multiple ray tracing libraries without changing the
  core XDG codebase. This is important for one of XDG's primary goals: to
  support ray tracing on both CPUs and GPUs in a single binary.
